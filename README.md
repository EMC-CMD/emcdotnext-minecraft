# emcdotnext-minecraft
this is the repository for our EMC Dotnext Team Minecraft Demo

This is a project the EMC Dotnext team is putting together to show how to take a Java Application running inside a Virtual Machine and then into a Docker Container.  In this instance, we are using Minecraft to show this.  The fun thing about Minecraft is you need persistent storage on the backend or each time a container goes away, the data goes away as well.  So we will be using ScaleIO and Rex-Ray to give our container persistent storage using EMC Products.
